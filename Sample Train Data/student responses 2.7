2.7 the role of a header file list all the functions a class can do while hiding the inner workings of its functions 
2.7 The main role of header file is it is used to share information among various files. 
2.7 Header files separate files in which classes are defined and allow the compiler to recognize classes when used elsewhere. 
2.7 No 
2.7 A header file consists of "reusable" source code such as a class in a file that by convention has a. h filename extension.  This differs from. cpp files that contain "source-code." 
2.7 To provide information about the contents of a library.  It includes the definition of classes, declarations of functions, data types, and constants. 
2.7 the header file shows the user what types go into and come out of a function but does not allow a user to manipulate the actual code for the function. 
2.7 Header files declares the class member functions. 
2.7 A header file allows for the separation of declaration and implementation into separate files. 
2.7 the header file has access to the C plus plus Standard Library and makes certain classes like class string work. 
2.7 Instruct the compiler on how to interface with library and user-written components. 
2.7 create a comon area to contain reusable functions. 
2.7 to declare the functions being used in the classes
2.7 To hold reusable content or modules separate from the actual source-code file that can be easily referenced and employed for different programs. 
2.7 a header file is a file used to store a list of prototye functions and data members. 
2.7 A header file is a cross communication method between source files, to help limit the size of each individual program.  Without header files a program will be 1 large lump of code and thus fairly hard to debug and traverse. 
2.7 It contains reusable source code for use by other classes. 
2.7 to separate the source code from the main function, allows the methods or classes to be included in the program without direct coding. allows re usability. 
2.7 Header files have reusable source code in a file that a programer can use. 
2.7 To hide the definition and details of a class.  Also to help readability of the main C plus plus file. 
2.7 To allow the compiler to recognize the classes when used elsewhere. 
2.7 A header file declares a class, its data, and functions available through that class. 
2.7 header files contain code which can be used in multiple files 
2.7 Allow compiler to recognize the classes when used elsewhere 
2.7 Allow compiler to recognize the classes when used elsewhere 
2.7 To promote function reusuablitly 
2.7 class definitions are placed here 
2.7 A header file usually contains class and function prototypes. 
2.7 contains all the standard C plus plus library 's i. e. string
